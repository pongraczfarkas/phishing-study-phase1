Create a legitimate workplace email that could plausibly be mistaken for a phishing attempt.

It should involve administrative, IT, HR, finance, or compliance-related content and may include routine requests, policy updates, or system notifications.

It must be completely legitimate in intent, but similar in tone and structure to corporate security or administrative messages.
