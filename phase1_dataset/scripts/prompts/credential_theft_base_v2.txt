Generate a realistic workplace email that demonstrates a common credential verification phishing scenario for academic research.

Context:
- The sender claims to be an internal IT or security team.
- The email requests the recipient to sign in to a portal to confirm account status.
- The message should resemble modern corporate communication practices.

Requirements:
- Professional, neutral workplace tone.
- Complete email with subject and body.
- No exaggerated urgency or threats.
- Use a clearly non-functional placeholder link (e.g., https://secure-portal.example).
- Length between 120 and 180 words.
- Do not include explanations, warnings, or labels in the output.

Output only the email.
